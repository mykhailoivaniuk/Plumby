## Overview
### Description
Plumby - prototype of the app for the services that ordinary users can request from professionals in order to fix problems that are related to their households. The app would function as a marketplace where professionals such as plumbers, carpenters will offer their service and user will choose the service provider that is best choice for user depending on the user financial situtation, location of the professional and ratings of the service provider. We believe that right now is the best time for this app because of Covid people will reimagine working places or continue working remotely. Thus the ability to effortlessly solve the problems that arise around the house will be essential in near future.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Marketplace
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but it will be just as viable on a computer. Functionality wouldnâ€™t be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version would be the main one as it would be the esaiest way for user to request the service.
- **Story:** App connects professionals with people who need to fix some problem in the household(plumbing, renovation etc) but can't do these tasks on their own.
- **Market:** Homeowners, apartment owners.
- **Habit:** People will use this app if they need to do some work around the house tht they can't do on their own. Possible examples are cleaning services, plumbing, tree cutting.
- **Scope:** First we will start with offering only one type of service in some location and later will expand the functionality to include different services.
